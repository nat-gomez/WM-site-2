About Dying Kindly

<p>
There are many problems with the United Stateâ€™s current funeral industry. Internment and cremation are unsustainable end-of-life choices because of the:
pollutants released in the process,
high costs,
and commercialization of death.
Death is personal, but it is also infrastructural and environmental.
This is a site for creating, sharing, and organizing a greener, kinder vision for the disposal and memorialization of our dead.

<h4>
Founder

<p>
Hi, I'm Natalie, founder of Dying Kindly.
One of the world's most pressing issues is climate change. While there are people organizing and trying to hold corporations and individuals accountable for our carbon footprint, there isn't much consideration of what our final acts on earth do to the environment.
I am not a mortician or expert in funeral or death care studies. I'm just a a person who believes that my death should be handled in a way that does not cause harm to the environment.
Growing up in Queens, NY, I was always surrounded by cemeteries. This is because in 1852, the public became suspicious that contamination from graveyards caused epidemics of cholera, so the Common Council passed a law prohibiting new burials in Manhattan. As a result, rural and lawn park cemeteries were created in Queens and surrounding boroughs to house the city's dead.
Living with a cemetery in my backyard helped me realize that existing cemeteries provide ecosystem services to plants, animals, and insects. Since many people avoid visiting cemeteries, old cemeteries become spaces where nature can once again take its course. However, with chemicals like formaldehyde from embalming fluid and heavy metals from caskets and vaults, our modern funerary practices are actually burying toxic, anthropogenic material into the soil.
In an attempt to honor loved ones, we are actually jeopardizing future generations.
I created this site as my senior thesis project in Contemporary Culture and Creative Production at the NYU School of Liberal Studies. Following the lead of eco-death pioneers like Katrina Spade and Caitlin Doughty, I hope to help shift cultural perception away from ostracizing death and towards thinking about cemeteries as green spaces and dying as part of a larger ecosystem cycle.
Dying Kindly is my experiment in community organizing, increasing access to public information, and forging camaraderie in support of practices that allow us to die more kindly.
